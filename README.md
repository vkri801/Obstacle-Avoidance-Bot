# Obstacle-Avoidance-Bot
Arduino Bot using SLAM, light source tracking, and obstacle avoidance.
The light source tracking used photo-transistors and a difference proportional controller.
The SLAM used discrete grid maps with point tracking for the robot. 
The localisation was a combination of ultrasonic sensors, IR sensors, and an MPU (primarily the accelerometer and gyroscope). 
The power source was a Lithium ion battery pack regulated to 12V and 9V for motor power supply and controller power supply.
